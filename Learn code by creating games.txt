== Risk / warlight / conquest
Description: Each territory has a certain number of armies which can be used to attack adjacent territories. 
The player can attack as often as they want, but conquering too many
 territories stretches out their troops so that the territories can be reclaimed easily. 
 Additional armies are given based on conquered territories, so not expanding fast enough 
 will also lead to losing. A straight forward AI is relatively easy to produce.

Variants: Dice Wars is a high-speed Flash game that is similar to Risk.


== Tkgem.tcl bejewled remake buble swap


== Asteroids
Description: The player rotates a ship to shoot asteroids, which break into two smaller asteroids when hit. 
The player must avoid being hit by the asteroids which slowly move around the screen. 
The player has no brakes, and can only slow or stop by using thrust in the opposite direction they are traveling.

Variants: Having different weapons and an occasional UFO that shoots directly at the player. 

== space invaders 
Description: A few rows of enemies gradually makes they're way down to the player. The player must shoot them all before they reach the bottom. 


== Scorched Earth / Worms / Gorillas / Angry Birds / hedgehogs
Description: Players control tanks on a 2D hilly terrain and enter the numeric angle and velocity of a cannonball shot. The object is hit the other player's tanks.

Variants: Angry Birds is a version of this game that adds a physics engine instead of hills.
 Different weapon types besides the standard cannonball can be added.
  Several UI improvements can be made over the original game 
  (using the mouse to enter the angle and velocity, displaying the previous turn's angle and velocity, etc.) 
Destructible terrain and being able to move the tanks adds a new dimension to the game.

== Crystal shooter bubble shoot
Add bubbles to existing bubbles and 



Description: The top of the board is filled with different colored bubbles. The player must shoot bubbles from the bottom to form a set of three bubbles of the same color in a row to make them disappear. The ceiling lowers over time. The player wins if the board is cleared of bubbles, and loses if the bubbles reach the bottom.

Variants: This is a similar game to Bejeweled, and the power ups used in that game could be used in this one.

== Fire 'N' Ice

YouTube video showing gameplay

Description: A very original but obscure puzzle game on the NES. The player controls a wizard who can make and unmake ice cubes, which need to fall on all the fire in a level to clear it. The ice can also be used as platforms, and individual blocks of ice can be pushed around. (As a platformer, making a clone of this might be a bit more involved. But the concept is original enough where I think it'd be worth the effort.)
